# CS Club Open Source Team Recruitment Technical Assessment 
Thank you for applying to the CS Club Open Source Team! All of our projects are maintained by student volunteers like yourself who are excited to learn, grow, and make a real impact.

To complete this assessment, you will need to [fork and clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository), implement and push your solutions to GitHub, and send a link of your fork to our **Open Source & Infrastructure Manager** Phoenix (`pbird99`) on Discord.

Note that this repository contains **ALL** questions for our technical screening and you are **NOT** required to attempt all questions!

See each of the subdirectories (`backend`, `bot`, `frontend`, `graphics`) for the relevant assessments. Please **carefully** read the submission instructions before you start coding. If we are unable to access your solutions, we cannot consider them in the recruitment process.

## Assessment Task Instructions
### General Projects Assessment
You should complete the [**backend**](./backend/README.md) **AND/OR** [**frontend**](./frontend/README.md) tasks depending on your areas of interest:

- If you're interested in a **backend-focused** role (e.g., APIs, server logic), complete the **backend tasks**.
- If you're interested in a **frontend-focused** role (e.g., UI, responsive design), complete the **frontend tasks**.
- If you're interested in a **full-stack** roles that involve both, we encourage you to complete **both tasks**. However, you **DO NOT** need to complete all the tasks in both sections.
